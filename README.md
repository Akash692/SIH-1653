## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Dependencies
Here are some things to know about network hub dependencies: Network project dependencies These are the relationships between tasks or activities that determine their order or timing. For example, you can't install a router until you have the cables and power supply. Network dependencies and parent/child relationships Network dependencies are often described as "parent/child" relationships, where the parent is the switch and the child is the server. Dependency network A dependency network is an internal data structure that can automatically recalculate property values based on changes to other property values. Leslie Graph A Leslie Graph is an abstraction that describes the dependencies between network, host, and application components. Intelligent hubs Intelligent hubs have software that allows them to detect and isolate network problems. This software can also help resolve issues with a device on the network. Hub A hub is a networking device that receives data signals from connected devices and broadcasts them to all other connected devices.
